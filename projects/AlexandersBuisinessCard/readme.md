# Alexander's Buisiness Card

I am making a Buisiness Card based on the Hacker Card template. It will be able to send my contact information to others via a nfc card and radio.

It will cost:
<!-- Describe your board in 2-3 sentences. What are you making? What will it do? -->

<!-- How much is it going to cost? -->

<!-- Tell us a little bit about your design process. What were some challenges? What helped? ***Totally optional*** -->
