# Alexander's Buisiness Card

I am making a Buisiness Card based on the Hacker Card template. It will be able to send my contact information to others via a nfc card and radio.

It will cost: $11.50

I am creating an NFC Business card. It will also have a qr code on it that links to my GitHub Profile!
